- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Hartman
- Iâ€™m focused on Alignment, data science, and machine learning engineering! I am a Data Scientist at Meta and love solving hard problems!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently working on CRM Automation / GenAI projects at my day job. My main focus in my off-time has been on deepening my understanding of AI as it transforms the world around us. You can see my thoughts at my blog theryanhartman.com or on X (formerly twitter) @theRyanHartman
- Most of my Repo are private (and from my days teaching myself Data Science in between classes in grad school), so if you are here to see some of my project work feel free to shoot me an email so I can add you as a collaborator!
- I am currently busy working hard at Meta and working on a few personal projects in my off-time. Though it is mostly my blog or a one of many SaaS ideas.
