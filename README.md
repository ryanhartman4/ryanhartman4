- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Ryan Hartman
- Iâ€™m interested in data science, quantitative and predictive analytics, and machine learning engineering! I love statistics and am currently a graduate student studying business analytics at Pepperdine University!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R, Python, and SQL programming skills/concepts. My main focus in my off-time has been on developing my understanding of machine learning applications in business, specifically predictive analytics and developments in machine learning products.
-  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything relevant to what I am studying! However, if any one needs an extra set of hands on projects in R or Python, I am always happy to help out.
